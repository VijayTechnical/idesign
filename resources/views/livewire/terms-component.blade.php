                            design services or any other services, the User agrees to pay all charges, taxes and
                            shipping and processing fees with an approved payment method.
                            <br>

                            done to the artwork files, job characteristics, or printing estimate time. You are
                            responsible for paying the entire amount of that print job, after a print job has been sent
                            to iDesignâ€™s press department, along with applicable taxes, shipping, and processing fees.
